* Developed an ‘intersect’ function to calculate the intersection
  between a given ray and sphere.
* Implemented the Phong’s Reflection Model to simulate ambience,
  diffuse, and specular material components.
* Incorporated recursive ray-tracing to incorporate reflections of
  other surfaces.
* Included shadowing by checking the intersection of preceding objects
  on the ray to not contribute light sources.
